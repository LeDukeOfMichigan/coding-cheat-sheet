# Coding Cheat Sheet

This is a simple page to show a few tips and reminders for different languages I use regularly for others who may forget particular things about coding on occasion.

## The Structure

The site is broken down by language to help you easily jump to the topic you want to review, and it includes some non-programming languages like Excel. The languages included are:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript
4. Excel
5. SQL
6. Other

The other category breaks down a few other odds and ends that were not associated with a particular language.

## Disclaimer

Please note that this cheat sheet has no guarantees of being updated and should only be used as a resource. You should always refer to the most up-to-date documentation from the actual developers who support whatever program or language you are using for proper support.
